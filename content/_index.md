Hi! I'm Michelle Lim. I am working on a new venture. 

Previously, I was the second employee at [Warp](https://www.warp.dev), a Sequoia-backed Series B company reimagining the terminal for developers. I initially joined as their first software engineer and built the public beta product. Then, I led Product and Growth, growing their user base to hundreds of thousands of users. More on the transition [here](writing/my-journey-to-growth-lead).

I also [invest in and advise early-stage startups](/investments). I advise startups on their [growth and data stack](https://twitter.com/michlimlim/status/1669467589888684038?s=20), growth strategy, and product/GTM hiring. If you're looking for an advisor, feel free to reach out!

I live in San Francisco. In my free time, I like to write essays on [engineering](writing/stop-using-frontend-backend/), [society](writing/its-not-about-the-stars/), and [film](writing/marvel-the-unwilling-pundit/). I enjoy watching films with friends, swimming, and Pilates. You can find me at [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/michlimlim), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michlimlim), [Github](https://www.github.com/michlimlim) or [email](mailto:limxlmichelle@gmail.com).
