Hi! I'm Michelle Lim. I'm a software engineer at an NYC-based startup. I also write [essays](/writing).

You can find me at [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/michlimlim), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michlimlim), [Github](https://www.github.com/michlimlim) or [email](mailto:limxlmichelle@gmail.com).

During my undergrad at Yale, I co-founded a healthcare startup called [Pillnotes](https://www.pillnotes.com/) and a startup incubator called [Yale Helix](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yhelix-group/about/). I also invested in startups with [Contrary Capital]("https://contrarycap.com/"). In the summers, I interned at Robinhood (building [Video News](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/stock-trading-app-robinhood-revamps-its-newsfeed-with-the-wall-street-journal-and-ad-free-videos/)), Slack, and Facebook.

In my free time, I read fiction, [paint oil paintings](/art), play squash and cycle. Fun fact: I sang in the Yale Russian chorus without knowing Russian!
