Hi! I'm Michelle Lim, and I live in NYC. I'm a founding software engineer at a 5-person startup. I also write [essays](/writing). You can find me at [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/michlimlim), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michlimlim), [Github](https://www.github.com/michlimlim) or [email](mailto:limxlmichelle@gmail.com).

During my undergrad at Yale, I co-founded a healthcare startup called [Pillnotes](https://www.pillnotes.com/) and a startup incubator called [Yale Helix](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yhelix-group/about/). I also invested in startups with [Contrary Capital](https://contrarycap.com/). In the summers, I interned at Robinhood (building [Video News](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/stock-trading-app-robinhood-revamps-its-newsfeed-with-the-wall-street-journal-and-ad-free-videos/)), Slack, and Facebook. Prior to undergrad, I grew up in Singapore.

**I'm passionate about healthcare, privacy, and climate change.** In my free time, I read fiction, [paint oil paintings](/art), play squash, and cycle. **If you're interested in chatting about these (or anything, really), please email/DM me.** I love meeting people.
