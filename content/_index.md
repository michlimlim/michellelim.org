Hi! I'm Michelle Lim, and I live in NYC. I'm the Growth Lead at [Warp](https://www.warp.dev). I also write [essays](/writing) on [engineering](writing/stop-using-frontend-backend/), [society](writing/its-not-about-the-stars/), and [film](writing/marvel-the-unwilling-pundit/). You can find me at [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/michlimlim), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michlimlim), [Github](https://www.github.com/michlimlim) or [email](mailto:limxlmichelle@gmail.com).

I joined Warp as the first software engineer. Currently, I’m running our Growth team, which spans product, data, and marketing. More on the transition [here](writing/my-journey-to-growth-lead).

I also [invest in and support early-stage startups](/investments), specializing in growth.

In my free time, I watch films and musicals with friends, swim, and do Pilates. I’m open to advising companies. You can email me at [limxlmichelle@gmail.com](mailto:limxlmichelle@gmail.com).
