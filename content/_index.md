Hi! I'm Michelle Lim, and I live in NYC. I'm the Growth Lead at [Warp](https://www.warp.dev). Previously, I had joined Warp as its first software engineer. More on the transition [here](writing/my-journey-to-growth-lead).

I also [invest in and advise early-stage startups](/investments), specializing in growth and engineer recruiting. I invest via [Sequoia's](https://www.sequoiacap.com/) Scout Program, and also personally. If you're looking for an advisor, feel free to reach out!

In my free time, I like to write essays on [engineering](writing/stop-using-frontend-backend/), [society](writing/its-not-about-the-stars/), and [film](writing/marvel-the-unwilling-pundit/). I enjoy watching films and musicals with friends, swimming, and Pilates. You can find me at [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/michlimlim), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michlimlim), [Github](https://www.github.com/michlimlim) or [email](mailto:limxlmichelle@gmail.com).
