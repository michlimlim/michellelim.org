  I learned how to draw and paint during the quarantine season of 2020.
  <br /><br />My favorite drawing channel is
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKgkOEqGFUOiXrx1klhlmJQ"
    >Art of Wei</a
  >, and my favorite painting channel is
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DrawMixPaint/"
    >Mark Carder's DrawMixPaint</a
  >. <br /><br />Here's some of my work:
