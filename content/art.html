<p>I took my first ever art class at the start of 2020 ("Basic Drawing" at Yale)
    and since then, I've been drawing and painting during quarantine season.

    <br><br>My favorite drawing channel is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKgkOEqGFUOiXrx1klhlmJQ">Art of
        Wei</a>,
    and my favorite painting channel is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DrawMixPaint/">Mark Carder's
        DrawMixPaint</a>.
    <br><br>Here's some of my work:
