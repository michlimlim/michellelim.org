#### Federated Learning

In today's world, we trade in our data and our privacy to technology companies in exchange for smarter routing, personalized feeds, and crowd intelligence. Federated learning lets you keep your privacy and get the intelligence you need. It is a type of collaborative machine learning that keeps all the training data on the end devices.
