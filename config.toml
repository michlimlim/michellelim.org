During my undergrad at Yale, I co-founded a healthcare startup called Pillnotes and a startup incubator called Yale Helix. I also invested in startups with Contrary Capital. In the summers, I interned at Robinhood (building Video News), Slack, and Facebook. In my free time, I read fiction, paint oil paintings, play squash and cycle. Fun fact: I sang in the Yale Russian chorus without knowing Russian!"
